Packev
======

Packev is a monitoring tool that emits an event everytime a new package is
updated or created in NPM.

#### Usage

```javascript
var packev = require('packev');
var options = {
    interval : 3000
};
var monitor = new packev(options);

monitor.on('data', function(package){
    console.log('New package in NPM: ', package.name);
});

monitor.on('error', function(err){
    throw err;
});

// All setted up, let's start the monitor
monitor.start();
```

#### Methods

* `on(event, callback)` register a callback for an event.
* `start()` starts the monitor.
* `stop()` stops the monitor.
* `status` a string containing the current status, can be `running` or `stopped`

#### Events

* `data` fired when a new/updated package is found, its callback receives the
package object.
* `error` when something whent wront, it's fired, its callback receives a error
object.
* `cicle` emitted when a checking cicle has ended.
* `stop` emitted when the check engine has stoped, after calling `stop()`.
* `start` emitted when the check engine has started, after calling `start()`.

#### Options

* `interval` set the interval in miliseconds to check for new packages. Default
is `5000`.
* `start` time in miliseconds to be removed from the first check time. This
way we can fetch older updates. Default is `5000`.
* `filter` a function that receives the package object and can be used to filter
what packages will be emitted, returning `true` or `false`. Default is `null`.
* `endpoint` the url fom where the package check will run.
* `fullPackage` a boolean to allow or not the full package information to be
fetched, default is `false`.
